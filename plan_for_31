Plan for 31

Server : 
    How to handle user accounts? I think actual accounts may not be necessary for games
    Give ability to pick own name and associate that name with a cookie (if possible)
    Lobby page where you enter the name of the room, name of yourself, and optional passcode
        Something similar to jackbox where a prompt comes up to choose a name before you can join a room
        If name is currently being used by another user, make them pick a different one

Client :
    Receives player info from server (how many, player scores)
    Receives hands from server (full hand for self, size of hand for others)
    
    Displays self player (and hand visible to self) and all other players (and hands hidden to self)
    Displays deck and discard pile
    
    Gets signal from players to start game and send to server
    Server receives signal, starts game, and returns info to client

    Server determines player order.
    
    Client allows players to make a move on their turn
    TODO - see if the moves one player makes updates to other clients automatically 
        or if needs to go through server and back to other clients

    Server receives data on move; either allows or denies it
    Update client
