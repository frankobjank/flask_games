# Overall layout

2 choices: lobby that is room-focused or landing page that is game-based (might look prettier than lobby)

Homepage - Lobby
    Players can create a new room for any purpose (i.e. 31, cribbage, natac)

Could combine the 2 by displaying bootstrap `card` on the right side of the screen and list the lobbies on the left

automatically delete a room when last player leaves

Things to display for lobby:
  Table of rooms:
    Room name - date created

## Plan for 31

Server : 
    How to handle user accounts? I think actual accounts may not be necessary for games
    Give ability to pick own name and associate that name with a cookie (if possible)
    Lobby page where you enter the name of the room, name of yourself, and optional passcode
        Something similar to jackbox where a prompt comes up to choose a name before you can join a room
        If name is currently being used by another user, make them pick a different one

Client :
    Receives player info from server (how many, player scores)
    Receives hands from server (full hand for self, size of hand for others)
    
    Displays self player (and hand visible to self) and all other players (and hands hidden to self)
    Displays deck and discard pile
    
    Gets signal from players to start game and send to server
    Server receives signal, starts game, and returns info to client

    Server determines player order.
    
    Client allows players to make a move on their turn
    TODO - see if the moves one player makes updates to other clients automatically 
        or if needs to go through server and back to other clients

    Server receives data on move; either allows or denies it
    Update client



Notes on sids:

SCENARIO - user connects
    logged in -> username is stored and can be used to identify user
    sid_to_user
    user_to_sid

    not logged in -> sid cannot be associated with username on join

SCENARIO - user joins room
    logged in: no changes

    not logged in -> sid_to_user, user_to_sid


SCENARIO - user leaves room
    no change because this does not affect session

SCENARIO - user disconnects
    username is not provided as it takes no arguments. must find username with sid
    username = sid_to_user[sid]


sid is particular to a window. Each new window/tab is a different session
a player can join as many rooms as they want - if they are opened in a new window/tab, a new sid is assigned

IF A PLAYER SWITCHES FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER WITHIN THE SAME SESSION THE SID STAYS THE SAME
