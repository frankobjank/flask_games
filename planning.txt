# Overall layout

Home page that is game-based
  Click game -> render lobby for specific games

  Can have an option for `All`

Lobby
  Table of rooms - sortable by any attribute -> create room or join an existing room

Room creation

  Put room into database on creation - Maybe limit to 5 created per person, prompt them to delete previous room if they've made 5

  Room schema:
  Room id
  Room name
  Room password - if blank,  no password is required. Set to NULL in sql
  Room game

  If game in progress - current game state? Push game states to database periodically? Or maybe on every move?
  Could create save state 

  Automatically delete a room when last player leaves?
  Delete room after (3?) days of inactivity

  Room that has 1 game and a chat box
  Button to go back to lobby (put in nav bar?)
